            The Military model M-16 and civilian model AR-15 semiautomatic rifles have the same basic parts with a few exceptions. The M-16 is also capable of switching from semi to fully automatic.
        </p>
        <ul style="text-align: justify;">
          <li>
            <strong>Muzzle compensator or flash suppressor</strong> – Starting at the front of the barrel will be either the muzzle compensator or flash suppressor. As the weapon is fired the muzzle compensator redirects the hot gases leaving the barrel in specific directions to lessen muzzle movement and recoil. The flash suppressor is configured so the hot gases leaving the barrel are disrupted with cooler air, limiting the burst of visible light aiding in concealment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The handguard</strong> – The handguard covers the rear portion of the barrel. The handguard encircles the barrel allowing the shooter to have a slip-resistant fore-grip that protects the shooter's hand from the hot barrel.
          <li>
            <strong>The carry handle</strong> – The carry handle is located on the top of the weapon behind the handguard. As the name suggests the carry handle allows the weapon to be carried with one hand.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The charging Handle</strong> – The charging handle is located behind the carry handle, just below the rear sight, and is used to charge the weapon. Pulling this handle rearward and releasing it will charge the weapon by loading a cartridge into the firing chamber.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Front and rear sights</strong> – Both the front post and the rear ghost ring sights are adjustable. On the rifle range, this adjustment is commonly referred to as zeroing the weapon.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The magazine well</strong> – Below the carry handle is a rectangular opening called the magazine well. This will accept a loaded magazine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The magazine button</strong> – A magazine release button, also called the magazine catch button, is located on the back of the magazine well. This button releases a locked magazine from the weapon so it may be replaced and locks the fresh magazine in place.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The bolt catch</strong> – Behind the magazine well is the bolt-catch lever. This locks the bolt back in the open breech position after the last round in the magazine is fired. Once a fresh magazine is loaded, the bolt catch is depressed, releasing the bolt and closing the weapon's firing chamber.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The selector lever</strong> – Behind the bolt catch is the selector lever. This lever will differ between civilian and military models. Both will have a position for single fire, meaning the weapon will fire one round when the trigger is pulled. Both will also have a safe position. When in this position, the weapon will not fire. On military models, the lever may have a full-auto position or a three-round burst mode. In the full-auto position, one squeeze of the trigger will fire multiple rounds. When in three-round-burst mode, the weapon will fire up to three rounds with each trigger squeeze.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stocks and hand-grips</strong> – Many different configurations exist, from fixed stocks to collapsible stocks depending on the type and purpose of the weapon. Rifle grips will also vary from pistol grips on military-type weapons to stock grips on many sporting rifles.
