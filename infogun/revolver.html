        <ul style="text-align: justify;">
          <li>
            <strong>Frame and Grip</strong> – The revolver's frame, which includes the trigger guard and grip, stands out in comparison to other firearms. Smaller, unloaded revolvers can weigh less than a pound.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trigger Guard</strong> – The trigger guard is a loop that surrounds the trigger. It prevents the shooter from accidentally firing the trigger before they are ready. You need to train yourself to keep your finger off the trigger and away from the trigger guard until you’re ready to shoot.
          <li>
            <strong>Barrel and Sights</strong> – When you shoot a revolver, the barrel, muzzle, and sights all come into play. The barrel and muzzle serve as the exit path for the projectile. The sights assist in precise aiming. See how these parts function together to help you increase accuracy when shooting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Muzzle</strong> – The muzzle is the very tip of the barrel. This is where the bullet leaves the gun. You can find certain muzzle-loading revolvers that require you to load the bullet into the handgun’s muzzle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Top Strap</strong> – The top strap runs along the top of the cylinder. It helps to reinforce the revolver so it’s stronger. The top strap is made out of metal. Some early revolvers may lack a top strap.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cylinder</strong> – The cylinder typically rotates out and opens to the left side of the frame. From there, shooters can insert ammo into the chambers. Most cylinders feature 5-10 chambers, depending on the model.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Crane/Yoke</strong> – The crane/yoke allows the cylinder to swing out from the frame. This piece supports the cylinder and acts as an arm of the cylinder. Certain brands will refer to this piece as either the crane or the yoke.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chamber</strong> – The chambers are empty openings located inside the cylinder. This is where the individual bullets will be inserted. One chamber can hold one round. It must be aligned with the barrel when shooting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ejector Rod</strong> – The ejector rod is a small rod that shooters press to eject the spent shells. This needs to be done manually. Double-action revolvers are more efficient than single-action and can eject all of the spent shells at once.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Extractor Star</strong> – The extractor star is a star-shaped piece that helps push the cartridges out of the cylinder. The cartridges catch on its star-shaped design once the ejector rod is pressed. You can think of it like a hook that catches on the cartridges.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Loading Gate</strong> – In revolvers with fixed cylinders, shooters need to load rounds through the loading gate. The loading gate is found at the back of the cylinder and can be opened so the shooter can insert or eject a round.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hammer</strong> – The hammer is located behind the cylinder. It serves the purpose of igniting the primer at the base of the ammunition. If the surface of your hammer is flat, it may have a floating firing pin. In single-action revolvers, you must manually cock the hammer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trigger</strong> – The trigger is the mechanism that fires the revolver. Never place your finger on the trigger until you’re ready to shoot. In the case of a double-action trigger, it can both cock the hammer and fire the revolver.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cylinder Release</strong> – Find the cylinder release (a small lever) on the left side of a revolver. To load and unload the revolver, use the cylinder release. Shooters can do this by either pushing it forward or pushing it down.
          </li>
