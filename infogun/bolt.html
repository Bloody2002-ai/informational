        <ul style="text-align: justify;">
          <li>
            <strong>Stock</strong> – Bolt-action rifles will have a fixed or adjustable buttstock. Being a highly accurate weapon the weld between the shooter's body and the weapon is critical. The stock must allow for a very secure and stable shooting platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Butt Plate</strong> – Also known as the recoil pad, it's the part that comes in direct contact with the shooter. As the weapon is fired the recoil forces will be transferred from the gun to the shooter through the recoil pad. Many of these pads are made of hard rubber to absorb a portion of the recoil force.
          <li>
            <strong>Bolt Handle</strong> – Unlike the semi-automatic, the bolt-action rifle will require the shooter to manually operate the bolt. The bolt handle will be lifted, which unlocks the bolt from the chamber. It will then be pulled to the rear, opening the chamber and extracting a spent cartridge, if one is present. The bolt will then be pushed forward, which will remove a new cartridge from the magazine and place it in the firing chamber. The final action is to lower the bolt handle, locking the bolt into a secure firing position.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bolt-action internal magazine</strong> – Larger caliber bolt-action rifles have an internal magazine. The rifle is loaded by bringing the bolt fully to the rear open position. The shooter then places cartridges into the open breech area and presses down into a spring-loaded magazine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Magazine floor plate</strong> – This is a hinged metal plate at the bottom of the receiver, which allows access to the magazine and covers the loading port in some bolt-action rifles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Manual safety</strong> – The safety mechanism will vary by manufacturer, but the most common location for the safety on bolt-action rifles is just behind the back of the bolt.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sighting system</strong> – While iron sights are available, because of the bolt-action rifle's accuracy, they are often replaced with optics better suited for longer distances. Most shooters prefer the enhanced sight picture that the fixed optics of a rifle scope give them. Rifle scopes are available in many different magnifications allowing a hunter to more clearly identify an intended target. Additionally, the crosshairs, elevation, and windage lines of a rifle scope allow the shooter to compensate for both wind and distance.
