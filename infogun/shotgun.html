            The pump-action shotgun is faster at cycling additional rounds than break-action models, making it a favorite with many hunters. It's best known as the traditional long gun of law enforcement. Often referred to as the police riot gun, its compact size and awesome firepower have made it a favorite with police for many years.
        </p>
        <ul style="text-align: justify;">
          <li>
            <strong>The action</strong> – The pump-action shotgun works on the same principle as a lever-action rifle: once the weapon is fired, the shooter pulls back on the fore-end grip, sliding it back. This opens the chamber, ejects the spent shell and allows the shell-carrier to raise the next shell into the loading position. As the shooter pushes the fore-end grip forward, the bolt moves forward, pushing the new shell into the chamber. Once the chamber is closed, the shooter is ready for their next shot.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The butt plate</strong> – The rearmost portion of the weapon will either be the butt plate or a more shock-absorbing recoil pad. The butt plate is held against the shooter's shoulder, transferring the shotgun's recoil force to the shooter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The stock & comb</strong> – The stock may be made of wood or a synthetic material. It provides three of the four points of contact between weapon and shooter: the butt, the comb and the grip. The butt rests on the shooter's shoulder. The comb contacts the shooter's cheek; this contact of the comb and the cheek is also known as the weld. The shooter's grip can either be high on the stock or on a pistol grip, allowing the shooter to grasp the weapon.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The trigger guard and safety</strong> – Just like on single and double-barrel shotguns, the trigger guard surrounds the trigger, preventing unintended contact. The safety switch on many pump shotguns is built into the back of the trigger guard. The safety is a button that can be pushed from either side of the weapon. Making the weapon safe requires pushing this button into the "safe" position. Most safeties will show a red side of the button if the weapon is in fire mode, but don't depend on this, as every weapon is different.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The action release</strong> – The action release is usually a button that is either built into or in front of the trigger guard. This button allows the action to be opened. It is used to either verify that a weapon is empty or to unload the weapon.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The tubular magazine</strong> – The pump-action shotgun has a tubular magazine that runs parallel to the barrel. The magazine's length will vary depending on the quantity of ammunition the weapon can legally hold. Some police riot guns have magazine extenders that are as long as the barrel, holding five or more rounds.
